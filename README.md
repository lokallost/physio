# Physio

*Correcting your cloud‚Äôs posture.*

Physio is an **open source, agentless Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM)** tool focused on **Azure**.
It scans your subscriptions for misconfigurations using read-only Azure APIs and helps teams improve their security posture.
Self-hosted. Easy to deploy. Built with **Python (backend)** and **React (frontend)**.

## Features (MVP)

* üîç Agentless scans of Azure subscriptions (via Service Principal)
* üß© Pluggable rule engine for misconfiguration checks
* üìä Outputs in table, JSON, and CSV
* üåê REST API + lightweight React UI to browse findings
* üê≥ Self-host with Docker (docker-compose for local, Helm chart later)
